# Transcribe and Clean with podcast-helper

`podcast-helper` is a CLI for podcast download and transcription workflows.

## Quick Reference

| Input Type | Example | Strategy |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Xiaoyuzhou URL | `https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/...` | Auto-resolves audio, transcribe directly |
| Apple Podcasts URL | `https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/.../id...?i=...` | iTunes Lookup API → audio URL |
| YouTube URL | `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...` | Extracts audio via yt-dlp |
| Spotify URL | `https://open.spotify.com/episode/...` | DRM-protected; prompts for RSS alternative |
| Pocket Casts URL | `https://pca.st/episode/...` | oEmbed → embed page → audio |
| Castro URL | `https://castro.fm/episode/...` | HTML audio extraction |
| Ximalaya URL | `https://www.ximalaya.com/sound/...` | Mobile track API |
| Podcast Addict URL | `https://podcastaddict.com/episode/...` | Decodes audio URL from path |
| Podcast page URL | `https://example.fm/episodes/42` | Discovers audio via og:audio / RSS / audio tags |
| Direct audio URL | `https://.../file.mp3` | Download and transcribe |
| Local audio file | `./audio/interview.mp3` | Transcribe directly |
| Smoke test | ElevenLabs public sample URL | For quick verification |

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Transcription requested | Run `transcribe` with `--json` flag |
| Cleanup requested | Fetch page via Jina Reader, produce `.cleaned.txt` sibling |
| Engine selection | Let CLI auto-detect unless user specifies |
| Transcription fails | Check API key → run `doctor` → verify URL → retry |
| Local/offline needed | Use `--engine mlx-whisper` on Apple Silicon |

## Detection Triggers

Activate this skill when the user:

- Mentions transcribing audio or podcast episodes
- Asks for subtitles (`.srt`) or transcripts (`.txt`)
- Provides a podcast URL (Xiaoyuzhou, Apple Podcasts, YouTube, Pocket Casts, Castro, Ximalaya, Podcast Addict, or any podcast host)
- Wants to clean or polish a raw ASR transcript
- Asks about podcast-helper CLI usage
- Needs local or offline transcription on Apple Silicon

## OpenClaw Setup (Recommended)

OpenClaw is the primary platform for this skill. It uses workspace-based prompt injection with automatic skill loading.

### Installation

**Via ClawdHub (recommended):**

```bash
clawdhub install dairui1/podcast-helper --skill transcribe
```

**Manual:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/skills/transcribe
cp skills/transcribe/SKILL.md ~/.openclaw/skills/transcribe/SKILL.md
```

### Workspace Structure

OpenClaw injects these files into every session:

```
~/.openclaw/
├── workspace/
│   ├── AGENTS.md          # multi-agent workflows, delegation patterns
│   ├── SOUL.md            # behavioral guidelines, principles
│   ├── TOOLS.md           # tool capabilities, integration gotchas
│   └── MEMORY.md          # long-term memory (main session only)
└── skills/
    └── transcribe/
        └── SKILL.md       # ← this file
```

Transcription output goes to the project tree:

```
project/
├── out/                   # transcription output (gitignored)
│   └── episode-name/
│       ├── episode.mp3
│       ├── episode.srt
│       ├── episode.txt
│       └── episode.cleaned.txt
└── ...
```

### Promotion Targets

When transcription conventions prove broadly applicable, promote them to workspace files:

| Convention | Promote To | Example |
|------------|------------|---------|
| Default output dir pattern | `AGENTS.md` | "Always use `./out/<episode-slug>/` for transcription output" |
| Preferred engine for project | `CLAUDE.md` | "Use `--engine groq` for this project" |
| Cleanup style rules | `SOUL.md` | "Preserve filler words for interview-style podcasts" |
| Tool gotchas | `TOOLS.md` | "yt-dlp needs periodic updates for YouTube" |

### Inter-Session Communication

OpenClaw provides tools to share transcription results across sessions:

- **sessions_list** — view active/recent sessions
- **sessions_send** — send transcript artifacts to another session
- **sessions_spawn** — spawn a sub-agent for batch transcription

## Claude Code Setup

Claude Code auto-loads `SKILL.md` from the skills directory and grants the declared `allowed-tools`.

### Installation

**Via skills CLI (recommended):**

```bash
npx skills add dairui1/podcast-helper --skill transcribe
```

**Global install (available across all projects):**

```bash
npx skills add dairui1/podcast-helper --skill transcribe -g
```

**Manual:**

```bash
# project-local
mkdir -p skills/transcribe
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dairui1/podcast-helper/main/skills/transcribe/SKILL.md \
  -o skills/transcribe/SKILL.md

# or global
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/transcribe
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dairui1/podcast-helper/main/skills/transcribe/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/transcribe/SKILL.md
```

### Optional: Hook Integration

Add hooks to `.claude/settings.json` for automatic post-transcription reminders:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "if echo \"$CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT\" | grep -q 'podcast-helper transcribe'; then echo 'Transcription complete — ask the user if they want cleanup.'; fi"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This injects a cleanup reminder after each transcription run (~20 tokens overhead). The hook is **opt-in** and not required.

## Generic Setup (Other Agents)

For Codex, Copilot, or other agents that do not auto-load `SKILL.md`, add a reference to your agent config file.

### CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md

```markdown
## Podcast Transcription

Use podcast-helper for transcription tasks:
1. `npx podcast-helper transcribe <input> --output-dir <dir> --json`
2. Check `skills/transcribe/SKILL.md` for full workflow details
3. After transcription, ask user if cleanup is needed
```

### .github/copilot-instructions.md

```markdown
## Podcast Transcription Skill

This project uses podcast-helper for audio transcription.
- CLI: `npx podcast-helper transcribe <url-or-file> --output-dir ./out --json`
- Supported sources: Xiaoyuzhou, Apple Podcasts, YouTube, Pocket Casts, Castro, Ximalaya, Podcast Addict, any RSS-backed page, direct audio URLs, local files
- Spotify is DRM-protected and unsupported
- See skills/transcribe/SKILL.md for full agent guidance
```

## Inputs

The main `transcribe` command accepts exactly one input:

- A Xiaoyuzhou episode URL
- An Apple Podcasts episode URL
- A YouTube video URL (requires `yt-dlp`)
- A Pocket Casts, Castro, Ximalaya, or Podcast Addict episode URL
- A public podcast episode page URL
- A direct audio URL such as `.mp3` or `.m4a`
- A local audio file path

Spotify URLs are detected but rejected with a DRM notice.

Examples:

```bash
npx podcast-helper transcribe https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/69b4d2f9f8b8079bfa3ae7f2 --output-dir ./out/episode --json
npx podcast-helper transcribe https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/example/id123456?i=789 --output-dir ./out/apple --json
npx podcast-helper transcribe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ --output-dir ./out/yt --json
npx podcast-helper transcribe https://example.fm/episodes/42 --output-dir ./out/episode-page --json
npx podcast-helper transcribe https://storage.googleapis.com/eleven-public-cdn/audio/marketing/nicole.mp3 --output-dir ./out/smoke --json
npx podcast-helper transcribe ./audio/interview.mp3 --output-dir ./out/local --json
```

Generic episode-page support works best when the page exposes:

- `og:audio` or similar audio metadata
- `<audio>` or `<source>` tags
- JSON-LD `AudioObject` or `PodcastEpisode`
- an alternate RSS or Atom feed that links back to the current episode page

That covers many host-powered public pages without a dedicated adapter, including pages commonly built on Buzzsprout, Libsyn, Simplecast, Podbean, Transistor, Castos, Omny, Acast, and Spreaker.

## Requirements & Engine Selection

### Environment Variables

| Provider | Env Variable | Engine Flag |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Local (Apple Silicon) | — | `mlx-whisper` |
| ElevenLabs | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | `elevenlabs` |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `openai` |
| Groq | `GROQ_API_KEY` | `groq` |
| Deepgram | `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` | `deepgram` |
| Gladia | `GLADIA_API_KEY` | `gladia` |
| AssemblyAI | `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` | `assemblyai` |
| Rev.ai | `REVAI_API_KEY` | `revai` |

### Auto-Detection Priority

The CLI selects engines in this order (first available wins):

1. Local `mlx-whisper` (if installed)
2. ElevenLabs → OpenAI → Groq → Deepgram → Gladia → AssemblyAI → Rev.ai (by API key presence)
3. Fallback to `mlx-whisper`

Use `--engine <provider>` only when you need to force a specific backend.

### Source Adapter Dependencies

| Adapter | External Dependency | Install |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| YouTube | `yt-dlp` | `brew install yt-dlp` or `pip install yt-dlp` |
| Local transcription | `ffmpeg`, `python3` | `brew install ffmpeg` |
| All others | — | No extra dependencies |

### Local Transcription Prerequisites

For Apple Silicon local transcription with `mlx-whisper`:

- `ffmpeg` must be installed
- `python3` must be available
- `podcast-helper setup mlx-whisper` installs the local runtime into a stable venv

Quick check:

```bash
printenv ELEVENLABS_API_KEY  # or whichever key you expect
podcast-helper doctor         # inspect local runtime status
```

## Preferred Command Form

Always prefer machine-readable output:

```bash
npx podcast-helper transcribe <input> --output-dir <dir> --json
```

The local workflow defaults to:

- a request-scoped temp workspace
- FFmpeg chunking at `300` seconds
- chunk-by-chunk partial transcript events on `stderr`
- automatic cleanup unless `--keep-temp` is set

Why:

- Progress goes to `stderr`
- Final success payloads are emitted as JSON on `stdout`
- Structured failure payloads are emitted as JSON on `stderr`
- Agents can parse the output without scraping logs

## Output Contract

The command produces:

- Original audio file
- `.srt` subtitle file
- `.txt` transcript file

### Success Response

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "transcribe",
  "input": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eleven-public-cdn/audio/marketing/nicole.mp3",
  "source": "remote-audio-url",
  "language": "eng",
  "artifacts": {
    "audio": "/abs/path/nicole.mp3",
    "srt": "/abs/path/nicole.srt",
    "txt": "/abs/path/nicole.txt"
  }
}
```

### Failure Response (stderr)

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "command": "transcribe",
  "error": {
    "code": "SOURCE_RESOLUTION_FAILED",
    "category": "source",
    "message": "Could not extract podcast audio from the provided page.",
    "hints": [
      "Pass the original episode page URL, a direct audio URL, or a local audio file.",
      "If this site hides audio metadata, download the audio separately and rerun `transcribe` with the file path."
    ]
  }
}
```

If you need machine-readable progress and terminal failures on the same stream, use `--progress jsonl`.

## Default Workflow

Use this order by default:

1. Transcribe with `podcast-helper`
2. Report the generated artifact paths
3. Ask whether the user also wants cleanup
4. If yes, fetch episode-page context through Jina Reader and produce a cleaned sibling transcript

Suggested follow-up question:

```text
Do you want me to clean the transcript as well?
```

## Execution Strategy

| Priority | Method | When to Use |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `npx podcast-helper transcribe ...` | Default for most users |
| 2 | `pnpm dlx podcast-helper transcribe ...` | pnpm environments |
| 3 | `podcast-helper transcribe ...` | Already installed globally |
| 4 | `node dist/cli.js transcribe ...` | Inside this repository only |

If the user explicitly wants local transcription on Apple Silicon, prefer `--engine mlx-whisper`.
If the user explicitly wants a specific hosted backend, prefer `--engine <provider>`.
Otherwise let the CLI choose based on the available provider API keys.

Do not default to repository build instructions unless you are already working inside this repository.

If you are inside the repository and `dist/cli.js` is missing, build first:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Then run:

```bash
node dist/cli.js transcribe <input> --output-dir <dir> --json
```

## Cleanup Workflow

Use this branch when:

- The user says yes to cleanup after transcription
- The user already has a raw `.txt` transcript and wants it polished

### Inputs

| Required | Optional |
|----------|----------|
| Original podcast URL | `.srt` file |
| Raw transcript `.txt` | Original audio file |

### Steps

Fetch the episode page through Jina Reader:

```bash
curl https://r.jina.ai/<podcast-url>
```

For example:

```bash
curl https://r.jina.ai/https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/69b4d2f9f8b8079bfa3ae7f2
```

Use the page content as reference context to:

- Fix obvious homophone and ASR mistakes
- Recover names, products, titles, and other proper nouns
- Remove repeated filler words and disfluencies when they are clearly redundant
- Normalize punctuation and paragraph breaks for readability

### Cleanup Rules

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Fix obvious ASR errors | Invent missing material |
| Recover proper nouns from page context | Summarize instead of cleaning |
| Remove redundant fillers | Overwrite the raw transcript |
| Normalize punctuation and paragraphs | Change speaker intent or factual content |

When cleanup is requested, keep the raw transcript unchanged and write a sibling file:

- Raw: `episode.txt`
- Cleaned: `episode.cleaned.txt`

If the episode URL is unavailable, clean conservatively using transcript-only evidence and state that no external episode context was used.

## Failure Modes

| Symptom | Diagnosis | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Transcription fails (hosted) | Wrong or missing API key | Verify matching env var is set |
| Transcription fails (local) | `mlx-whisper` not installed | Run `podcast-helper doctor` then `podcast-helper setup mlx-whisper` |
| YouTube extraction fails | `yt-dlp` not installed or outdated | `brew install yt-dlp` or `pip install -U yt-dlp` |
| Spotify URL rejected | DRM-protected content | Find the same episode on Apple Podcasts or its RSS feed |
| Source resolution fails | URL unreachable or audio hidden | Verify URL; download audio manually and pass file path |
| Build missing (`dist/cli.js`) | Repository not built | Run `pnpm run check && pnpm run build` |
| Cleanup quality poor | Page context insufficient | Re-fetch Jina Reader page; prefer fewer edits if lacking context |

## Multi-Agent Support

This skill works across different AI coding agents with platform-specific activation.

### OpenClaw / ClawdHub (Recommended)

**Activation**: Workspace injection via skill directory
**Setup**: `clawdhub install dairui1/podcast-helper --skill transcribe`
**Detection**: Automatic via workspace skill loading
**Inter-session**: Share transcription results via `sessions_send`

### Claude Code

**Activation**: Auto-loaded from `skills/transcribe/SKILL.md`
**Setup**: `npx skills add dairui1/podcast-helper --skill transcribe`
**Tools**: Declared in `allowed-tools` frontmatter; granted automatically
**Hooks**: Optional `PostToolUse` hook for cleanup reminders (see Claude Code Setup)

### Codex CLI

**Activation**: Manual reference in agent config
**Setup**: Copy `SKILL.md` to project and reference from `AGENTS.md`
**Detection**: Agent reads `AGENTS.md` at session start

### GitHub Copilot

**Activation**: Manual (no skill auto-loading)
**Setup**: Add transcription workflow to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (see Generic Setup)
**Detection**: Manual — user invokes via chat prompt

### Agent-Agnostic Guidance

Regardless of platform, apply this skill when:

1. **User shares a podcast URL** — any supported platform or generic episode page
2. **User has an audio file** — local or remote, needs transcription
3. **User wants subtitles** — `.srt` generation from audio
4. **User mentions ASR cleanup** — polishing a raw transcript
5. **User asks about podcast-helper** — CLI usage, engine selection, setup

## Agent Best Practices

1. **Use cheap audio for smoke tests** — `https://storage.googleapis.com/eleven-public-cdn/audio/marketing/nicole.mp3`
2. **Dedicated output dirs** — one per task to avoid file conflicts
3. **Report artifacts** — always tell the user the generated file paths
4. **Prefer npx/pnpm dlx** — when the CLI is not already installed
5. **Check env first** — verify API keys before attempting hosted transcription
6. **Let CLI auto-detect** — only force `--engine` when the user asks for a specific backend
7. **Ask before cleanup** — don't assume the user wants transcript polishing
8. **Conservative cleanup** — preserve speaker intent; fewer edits are better than hallucinated fixes
9. **YouTube needs yt-dlp** — verify installation before attempting YouTube URLs
10. **Spotify is unsupported** — suggest Apple Podcasts or RSS feed as alternative
