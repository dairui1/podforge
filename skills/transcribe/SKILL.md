# Transcribe and Clean with podcast-helper

`podcast-helper` is a CLI for podcast download and transcription workflows.

Use this skill when the user wants any of the following:

- Transcribe a Xiaoyuzhou episode URL
- Transcribe a public podcast episode page that exposes audio metadata or a discoverable RSS/Atom feed
- Transcribe a direct remote audio URL
- Transcribe a local audio file
- Generate subtitle files (`.srt`)
- Generate plain transcript files (`.txt`)
- Clean a raw transcript after transcription
- Fix obvious ASR mistakes with episode-page context
- Run local transcription on Apple Silicon
- Use a specific AI SDK transcription provider such as OpenAI, Groq, Deepgram, Gladia, AssemblyAI, or Rev.ai

## Inputs

The main `transcribe` command accepts exactly one input:

- A Xiaoyuzhou episode URL
- A public podcast episode page URL
- A direct audio URL such as `.mp3` or `.m4a`
- A local audio file path

Examples:

```bash
npx podcast-helper transcribe https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/69b4d2f9f8b8079bfa3ae7f2 --output-dir ./out/episode --json
npx podcast-helper transcribe https://example.fm/episodes/42 --output-dir ./out/episode-page --json
npx podcast-helper transcribe https://storage.googleapis.com/eleven-public-cdn/audio/marketing/nicole.mp3 --output-dir ./out/smoke --json
npx podcast-helper transcribe ./audio/interview.mp3 --output-dir ./out/local --json
```

Generic episode-page support works best when the page exposes:

- `og:audio` or similar audio metadata
- `<audio>` or `<source>` tags
- JSON-LD `AudioObject` or `PodcastEpisode`
- an alternate RSS or Atom feed that links back to the current episode page

That covers many host-powered public pages without a dedicated adapter, including pages commonly built on Buzzsprout, Libsyn, Simplecast, Podbean, Transistor, Castos, Omny, Acast, and Spreaker.

## Requirements

- The CLI can be invoked from npm with `npx` or `pnpm dlx`, or run from the repository
- Cleanup with Jina Reader is optional and does not require ElevenLabs

For ElevenLabs runs:

- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` must be set

Other supported remote providers:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` -> `openai`
- `GROQ_API_KEY` -> `groq`
- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` -> `deepgram`
- `GLADIA_API_KEY` -> `gladia`
- `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` -> `assemblyai`
- `REVAI_API_KEY` -> `revai`

For Apple Silicon local transcription with `mlx-whisper`:

- `ffmpeg` must be installed
- `python3` must be available
- `podcast-helper setup mlx-whisper` installs the local runtime into a stable venv

Check the API key first if transcription is expected to run:

```bash
printenv ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
```

Default engine selection:

- If local `mlx-whisper` is available, omit `--engine` and let the CLI use `mlx-whisper`
- Else if `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is present, omit `--engine` and let the CLI use `elevenlabs`
- Else if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is present, omit `--engine` and let the CLI use `openai`
- Else if `GROQ_API_KEY` is present, omit `--engine` and let the CLI use `groq`
- Else if `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` is present, omit `--engine` and let the CLI use `deepgram`
- Else if `GLADIA_API_KEY` is present, omit `--engine` and let the CLI use `gladia`
- Else if `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` is present, omit `--engine` and let the CLI use `assemblyai`
- Else if `REVAI_API_KEY` is present, omit `--engine` and let the CLI use `revai`
- Otherwise omit `--engine` and let the CLI fall back to `mlx-whisper`
- Use `--engine <provider>` only when you need to force a specific backend

## Preferred Command Form

Prefer machine-readable output:

```bash
npx podcast-helper transcribe <input> --output-dir <dir> --json
```

The local workflow defaults to:

- a request-scoped temp workspace
- FFmpeg chunking at `300` seconds
- chunk-by-chunk partial transcript events on `stderr`
- automatic cleanup unless `--keep-temp` is set

Why:

- Progress goes to `stderr`
- Final success payloads are emitted as JSON on `stdout`
- Structured failure payloads are emitted as JSON on `stderr`
- Agents can parse the output without scraping logs

## Output Contract

The command produces:

- Original audio file
- `.srt` subtitle file
- `.txt` transcript file

Typical JSON output:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "transcribe",
  "input": "https://storage.googleapis.com/eleven-public-cdn/audio/marketing/nicole.mp3",
  "source": "remote-audio-url",
  "language": "eng",
  "artifacts": {
    "audio": "/abs/path/nicole.mp3",
    "srt": "/abs/path/nicole.srt",
    "txt": "/abs/path/nicole.txt"
  }
}
```

Typical JSON failure output on `stderr`:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "command": "transcribe",
  "error": {
    "code": "SOURCE_RESOLUTION_FAILED",
    "category": "source",
    "message": "Could not extract podcast audio from the provided page.",
    "hints": [
      "Pass the original episode page URL, a direct audio URL, or a local audio file.",
      "If this site hides audio metadata, download the audio separately and rerun `transcribe` with the file path."
    ]
  }
}
```

If you need machine-readable progress and terminal failures on the same stream, use `--progress jsonl`.

## Default Workflow

Use this order by default:

1. Transcribe with `podcast-helper`
2. Report the generated artifact paths
3. Ask whether the user also wants cleanup
4. If yes, fetch episode-page context through Jina Reader and produce a cleaned sibling transcript

Suggested follow-up question:

```text
Do you want me to clean the transcript as well?
```

When cleanup is requested, keep the raw transcript unchanged and write a sibling file:

- Raw: `episode.txt`
- Cleaned: `episode.cleaned.txt`

## Execution Strategy

Use this order of preference:

1. `npx podcast-helper transcribe ...`
2. `pnpm dlx podcast-helper transcribe ...`
3. `podcast-helper transcribe ...`
4. In this repository: `node dist/cli.js transcribe ...`

If the user explicitly wants local transcription on Apple Silicon, prefer `--engine mlx-whisper`.
If the user explicitly wants a specific hosted backend, prefer `--engine <provider>`.
Otherwise let the CLI choose based on the available provider API keys.

Do not default to repository build instructions unless you are already working inside this repository.

If you are inside the repository and `dist/cli.js` is missing, build first:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Then run:

```bash
node dist/cli.js transcribe <input> --output-dir <dir> --json
```

## Agent Guidance

- Prefer a small public audio file for smoke tests to reduce transcription cost.
- Use `https://storage.googleapis.com/eleven-public-cdn/audio/marketing/nicole.mp3` for a cheap live verification unless the user explicitly wants a real podcast episode.
- Use a dedicated output directory per task.
- Report the generated artifact paths back to the user.
- Prefer `npx` or `pnpm dlx` when the user does not already have the CLI installed.
- If the user wants local or offline transcription on Apple Silicon, switch to `--engine mlx-whisper`.
- If local setup is missing, run `podcast-helper doctor` first, then `podcast-helper setup mlx-whisper`.
- If the user has not asked for a specific backend, check the available provider API keys and let the CLI choose automatically.
- If the input is a Xiaoyuzhou episode or a public podcast episode page, the CLI resolves and downloads the source audio automatically.
- After transcription, if the user appears to want a polished transcript, ask whether they also want cleanup.

## Cleanup Workflow

Use this branch when:

- The user says yes to cleanup after transcription
- The user already has a raw `.txt` transcript and wants it polished

Recommended inputs:

- The original podcast URL
- The raw transcript file, usually `.txt`

Optional but useful:

- The `.srt` file
- The original audio file

Fetch the episode page through Jina Reader:

```bash
curl https://r.jina.ai/<podcast-url>
```

For example:

```bash
curl https://r.jina.ai/https://www.xiaoyuzhoufm.com/episode/69b4d2f9f8b8079bfa3ae7f2
```

Use the page content as reference context to:

- Fix obvious homophone and ASR mistakes
- Recover names, products, titles, and other proper nouns
- Remove repeated filler words and disfluencies when they are clearly redundant
- Normalize punctuation and paragraph breaks for readability

Apply conservative cleanup:

- Preserve speaker intent and factual content
- Do not invent missing material
- Do not summarize instead of cleaning
- Do not overwrite the raw transcript

If the episode URL is unavailable, clean conservatively using transcript-only evidence and state that no external episode context was used.

## Failure Modes

If transcription fails:

- Verify which backend was selected
- If a hosted backend was selected, verify the matching API key is present
- If local `mlx-whisper` was selected, run `podcast-helper doctor`
- If local `mlx-whisper` is missing, run `podcast-helper setup mlx-whisper`
- Verify the input URL is reachable
- Re-run with a fresh output directory
- If using the repository build, run `pnpm run check` and `pnpm run build`

If cleanup quality is uncertain:

- Verify the podcast URL matches the transcript
- Re-fetch the Jina Reader page and inspect whether it contains useful episode metadata
- Prefer fewer edits when the page does not provide enough grounding
